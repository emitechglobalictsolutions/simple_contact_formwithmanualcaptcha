This is a simple form for contact page on php to carry form variable from the label cells and send to the email in the thankyou folder where it will be used to upload the form message to email assigned in the index.php inside the thankyou folder
that captcha image is the piccaptcha.jpg

Explanation:
CAPTCHA Section:

I've added a new row for the CAPTCHA image (piccaptcha.jpg) and a text input where users can enter the CAPTCHA code.
The CAPTCHA input has a placeholder guiding users on what to do.
JavaScript Validation:

The input event listener on the CAPTCHA input field (captcha) checks the entered value.
If the entered value matches the exact CAPTCHA code (3BASee12), the submit button is enabled; otherwise, it remains disabled.
An error message in red is displayed if the CAPTCHA is incorrect, and it disappears when the correct code is entered.
PHP Form Action:

The form action points to thankyou/index.php, where you can process the form data after successful CAPTCHA verification.
This setup ensures the form can only be submitted when the CAPTCHA is correctly entered, making the form more secure.
